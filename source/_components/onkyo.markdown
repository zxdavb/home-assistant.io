The `onkyo` platform allows you to control a [Onkyo](http://www.onkyo.com/), [Integra](http://www.integrahometheater.com/)
 and some recent [Pioneer](http://www.pioneerelectronics.com) receivers from Home Assistant. Please be aware that you need to enable "Network Standby" for this integration to work in your Hardware.

## Configuration

To add an Onkyo or Pioneer receiver to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: onkyo
    host: 192.168.1.2
    name: receiver
    sources:
      pc: 'HTPC'
```

 If your receiver has second or third zoneâ€™s available, they are displayed as additional media players with the same functionality as the main zone.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: IP address of the device. Example:`192.168.1.2`. If not specified, the platform will load any discovered receivers.
  required: false
  type: string
name:

  required: false

### Service `onkyo_select_hdmi_output`

Changes HDMI output of your receiver

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | no | String or list of a single `entity_id` that will change output.
| `hdmi_output` | no | The desired output code.

Accepted values are:
'no', 'analog', 'yes', 'out', 'out-sub', 'sub', 'hdbaset', 'both', 'up'
which one to use seems to vary depending on model so you will have to try them out.
( For model TX-NR676E it seems to be 'out' for main, 'out-sub' for sub, and 'sub' for both )

### Example `play_media` script

The `play_media` function can be used in script to play radio station by preset number.
Not working for NET radio.

```yaml
# Example play_media script
#
script:
 radio1:
    alias: "Radio 1"
    sequence:
      - service: media_player.turn_on
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
      - service: media_player.play_media
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
          media_content_type: "radio"
          media_content_id: "1"

```

### Example `onkyo_select_hdmi_output` script

```yaml
# Example onkyo_select_hdmi_output script
#
script:
 hdmi_sub:
    alias: "Hdmi out projector"
    sequence:
      - service: media_player.onkyo_select_hdmi_output
        service_data:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
          hdmi_output: out-sub

```
