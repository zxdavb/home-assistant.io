The `androidtv` platform allows you to control an Android TV device or [Amazon Fire TV](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=8521791011) device.

## Device preparation

To set up your device, you will need to find its IP address and enable ADB debugging. For Android TV devices, please consult the documentation for your device.

For Fire TV devices, the instructions are as follows:

- Turn on ADB Debugging on your Amazon Fire TV:
  - From the main (Launcher) screen, select Settings.
  - Select My Fire TV > Developer Options.
  - Select ADB Debugging.
- Find Amazon Fire TV device IP address:
  - From the main (Launcher) screen, select Settings.
  - Select My Fire TV > About > Network.

## Configuration

```

## ADB Setup

This integration works by sending ADB commands to your Android TV / Fire TV device. There are two ways to accomplish this:

### 1. ADB Server

You can use an ADB server to connect to your Android TV and Fire TV devices.

For Hass.io users, you can install the [Android Debug Bridge](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adb/blob/master/README.md) addon. Using this approach, Home Assistant will send the ADB commands to the server, which will then send them to the Android TV / Fire TV device and report back to Home Assistant. To use this option, add the `adb_server_ip` option to your configuration. If you are running the server on the same machine as Home Assistant, you can use `127.0.0.1` for this value.

### 2. Python ADB Implementation

The second option is to connect to your device using the `adb` Python package.

If your device requires ADB authentication, you will need to follow the instructions in the [ADB Authentication](#adb-authentication) section below. Once you have an authenticated key, this approach does not require any additional setup or addons. However, users with newer devices may find that the ADB connection is unstable. For a Fire TV device, you can try setting the `get_sources` configuration option to `false`.  If the problem cannot be resolved, you should use the ADB server option.

#### ADB Authentication

If you get a "Device authentication required, no keys available" error when trying to set up your Android TV or Fire TV, then you'll need to create an adbkey and add its path to your configuration. Follow the instructions on this page to connect to your device from your computer: [Connecting to Fire TV Through adb](https://developer.amazon.com/zh/docs/fire-tv/connecting-adb-to-device.html).

<div class='note warning'>
In the dialog appearing on your Android TV / Fire TV, you must check the box that says "always allow connections from this device." ADB authentication in Home Assistant will only work using a trusted key.
</div>

Once you've successfully connected to your Android TV / Fire TV via the command `adb connect <ipaddress>:5555`, the file `adbkey` will be created on your computer. The default locations for this file is (from [https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)):

- Linux and Mac: `$HOME/.android.`
- Windows: `%userprofile%\.android.`

Copy the `adbkey` file to your Home Assistant folder and add the path to the `adbkey` file to your configuration.

## ADB Troubleshooting

If you receive the error message `Error while setting up platform androidtv` in your log when trying to set up an Android TV or Fire TV device, then there is probably an issue with your ADB connection. Here are some possible causes.

1. ADB is not enabled on your device.

2. You are already connected to the Android TV / Fire TV via ADB from another device. Only one device can be connected, so disconnect the other device, restart the Android TV / Fire TV (for good measure), and then restart Home Assistant.

3. If you are using the [Python ADB implementation](#2-python-adb-implementation):

   * This method often does not work for newer devices. Use the [ADB server](#1-adb-server) approach instead.

   * Your key is not pre-authenticated. Before using the `adbkey` in Home Assistant, you _**must**_ connect to your device using the ADB binary and tell it to always allow connections from this computer. For more information, see the section [ADB Authentication](#adb-authentication) above.

   * Home Assistant does not have the appropriate permissions for the `adbkey` file and so it is not able to use it. Once you fix the permissions, the integration should work.

4. Some Android TV devices (e.g., Philips TVs running Android TV) only accept the initial ADB connection request over their Wi-Fi interface. If you have the TV wired, you need to connect it to WiFi and try the initial connection again. Once the authentication has been granted via Wi-Fi, you can connect to the TV over the wired interface as well.

## Services

### `media_player.select_source`

For Fire TV devices, you can launch an app using the `media_player.select_source` command. Simply provide the app ID as the `source`.  You can also stop an app by prefixing the app ID with a `!`. For example, you could define [scripts](/docs/scripts) to start and stop Netflix as follows:

```yaml
start_netflix:
  sequence:
  - service: media_player.select_source
    data:
      entity_id: media_player.fire_tv_living_room
      source: 'com.netflix.ninja'

stop_netflix:
  sequence:
  - service: media_player.select_source
    data:
      entity_id: media_player.fire_tv_living_room
      source: '!com.netflix.ninja'
```

### `androidtv.adb_command`

The service `androidtv.adb_command` allows you to send either keys or ADB shell commands to your Android TV / Fire TV device. If there is any output, it will be stored in the `'adb_response'` attribute (i.e., `state_attr('media_player.android_tv_living_room', 'adb_response')` in a template) and logged at the INFO level.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id`            |       no | Name(s) of Android TV / Fire TV entities.
| `command`              |       no | Either a key command or an ADB shell command.

In an [action](/getting-started/automation-action/) of your [automation setup](/getting-started/automation/) it could look like this:

```yaml
action:
  service: androidtv.adb_command
  data:
    entity_id: media_player.androidtv_tv_living_room
    command: "HOME"
```

Available key commands include:

- `POWER`
- `SLEEP`
- `HOME`
- `UP`
- `DOWN`
- `LEFT`
- `RIGHT`
- `CENTER`
- `BACK`
- `MENU`

The full list of key commands can be found [here](https://github.com/JeffLIrion/python-androidtv/blob/bf1058a2f746535921b3f5247801469c4567e51a/androidtv/constants.py#L143-L186).

You can also use the command `GET_PROPERTIES` to retrieve the properties used by Home Assistant to update the device's state.  These will be stored in the media player's `'adb_response'` attribute and logged at the INFO level, this information can be used to help improve state detection in the backend [androidtv](https://github.com/JeffLIrion/python-androidtv) package.

## Custom State Detection

The `state_detection_rules` configuration parameter allows you to provide your own rules for state detection.  The keys are app IDs, and the values are lists of rules that are evaluated in order.  Valid rules are:

* `'standby'`, `'playing'`, `'paused'`, `'idle'`, or `'off'`
  * If this is not a map, then this state will always be reported when this app is the current app
  * If this is a map, then its entries are conditions that will be checked.  If all of the conditions are true, then this state will be reported.  Valid conditions pertain to 3 properties (see the example configuration above):
    1. ``'media_session_state'``
    2. ``'audio_state'``
    3. ``'wake_lock_size'``
* `'media_session_state'` = try to use the `media_session_state` property to determine the state
* `'audio_state'` = try to use the `audio_state` property to determine the state

To determine what these rules should be, you can use the `androidtv.adb_command` service with the command `GET_PROPERTIES`, as described in the [androidtv.adb_command](#androidtvadb_command) section.
