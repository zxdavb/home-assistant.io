The Jewish Calendar (`jewish_calendar`) sensor platform displays a variety of information related to the Jewish Calendar as a variety of sensors.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
jewish_calendar:
```

{% configuration %}
language:
  required: false
  default: english
  description: Whether to represent the sensors in Hebrew (א' תשרי תשע"ט) or English characters (1 Tishrei 5779). Valid options are 'english' and 'hebrew'.
  type: string
latitude:
  required: false
  description: Latitude for time calculations of the sensor.
  default: Home Assistant location
  type: integer
longitude:
  required: false
  description: Longitude for time calculations of the sensor.
  default: Home Assistant location
  type: integer
diaspora:
  required: false
  description: Consider the location as diaspora or not for calculation of the weekly portion and holidays.
  default: false
  type: string
candle_lighting_minutes_before_sunset:
  required: false
  description: Number of minutes before sunset to report as candle lighting time.
  default: 18
  type: integer
havdalah_minutes_after_sunset:
  required: false
  description: Number of minutes after sunset to report as havdalah time. If this is set to 0, uses the time that the sun is 8.5 degrees below the horizon (same as the 'three_stars' sensor). If non-zero, this value is added as an offset to the time of sunset to report havdalah.
  default: 0
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

## Sensor list

### Data sensors
- date: Shows the hebrew date for today.
- weekly_portion: Shows the weekly portion (parshat hashavu'a).
- holiday_name: If it is a holiday, shows the name of the holiday.
- holiday_type: Shows the type of the holiday _(see below)_.
- omer_count: An integer sensor indicating the day of the Omer (1-49) or 0 if it is not currently the Omer.

### Time sensors
- first_light: First light of dawn (Alot Hashachar - עלות השחר).
- gra_end_shma: Last time for reading of the Shma according to the GR"A.
- mga_end_shma: Last time for reading of the Shma according to the MG"A.
- plag_mincha: Time of the Plag Hamincha.
- first_stars: Time at which the first stars are visible (Tset Hakochavim - צאת הכוכבים).
- upcoming_shabbat_candle_lighting: The time of candle lighting for either the current Shabbat (if it is currently Shabbat) or the immediately upcoming Shabbat.
- upcoming_shabbat_havdalah: The time of havdalah for either the current Shabbat (if it is currently Shabbat) or the immediately upcoming Shabbat. If it is currently a three-day holiday, this value *could* be None (i.e. if holiday is Sat./Sun./Mon. and it's Saturday, there will be no shabbat_havdalah value. See comments in hdate library for details.)
- upcoming_candle_lighting: The time of candle lighting for either the current Shabbat OR Yom Tov, or the immediately upcoming Shabbat OR Yom Tov. If, for example, today is Sunday, and Rosh Hashana is Monday night through Wednesday night, this reports the candle lighting for Rosh Hashana on Monday night. This avoids a situation of triggering pre-candle-lighting automations while it is currently Yom Tov. To always get the Shabbat times, use the upcoming_shabbat_candle_lighting sensor.
- upcoming_havdalah: The time of havdalah for either the current Shabbat OR Yom Tov, or the immediately upcoming Shabbat OR Yom Tov. If, for example, today is Sunday, and Rosh Hashana is Monday night through Wednesday night, this reports the havdalah for Rosh Hashana on Wednesday night. To always get the Shabbat times, use the upcoming_shabbat_havdalah sensor.

### Binary sensors
- issur_melacha_in_effect: A boolean sensor indicating if melacha is currently not permitted. The value is true when it is currently Shabbat or Yom Tov and false otherwise.
