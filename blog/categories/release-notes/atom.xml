Almost a 100 contributors to this release 🎉  That's what you get when you skip a release. It's a little late but "Happy New Year" and welcome to 0.61 the first release 2018.

This release contain some breaking changes. Please make sure that you check the section below if you are running into trouble.

## <a class='title-link' name='assistant-configs' href='#assistant-configs'></a> Assistant configs 

We made a mistake in the foundation of both the Google Assistant and Alexa integrations: they were storing their config inside customize. This is not the right place and we moved them to be under the components itself. See the breaking changes section on how to migrate.

## <a class='title-link' name='hassio-updates' href='#hassio-updates'></a> Hass.io updates 

[@pvizeli] has made it easier to create and restore snapshots for Hass.io by calling the new services. This way it will be easy to automate the creation of a snapshot at night. The updater has also been fixed and will now report on new versions of Hass.io that are available.

## <a class='title-link' name='improved-loading-speed' href='#improved-loading-speed'></a> Improved loading speed 

[@amelchio] has made startup of Home Assistant _even_ faster. All service descriptions are now loaded only when needed by the frontend instead of during startup. This did mean that we had to enforce our service convention. We found a few platforms that didn't follow this and they have been updated:

```text
todoist.new_task -> calendar.todoist_new_task

snapcast.snapcast_snapshot -> media_player.snapcast_snapshot
snapcast.snapcast_restore -> media_player.snapcast_restore

mopar.remote_command -> sensor.mopar_remote_command

broadlink.learn_command_192_168_0_107 -> switch.broadlink_learn_command_192_168_0_107
broadlink.send_packet_192_168_0_107 -> switch.broadlink_send_packet_192_168_0_107
```

## <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes 

- Extend Threshold binary sensor to support ranges. This means that you can now set `up` and `lower`. ([@DanNixon] - [#11110]) ([binary_sensor.threshold docs]) (breaking change)
- The Steam game platform contains changes:
  - `game` attribute no longer set in `device_state_attributes` if no game is currently being played as the string "None" is no longer passed if no current game is being played, instead the `game` attribute is not present.
  - States now use lower snake case.
  - The "Play" and "Trade" states has been renamed to "looking_to_play" and "looking_to_trade".
    ([@frwickst] - [#11182]) ([sensor.steam_online docs]) (breaking change)
- The [`tile`][device_tracker.tile docs] platform now shows only active Tiles by default; to show all Tiles, including expired/inactive ones, `show_inactive` must be `True`. The following state attributes have been removed: `last_seen` and `last_updated`. ([@bachya] - [#11172]) ([device_tracker.tile docs]) (breaking change)
- The `hidden_string` feature has been removed from the isy994 component. Previously, this allowed entities to be "hidden" in Home Assistant if a configured string was present in an ISY device's name or folder path. This was removed because hiding devices is now done via the customization feature.
Note however, that this feature was replaced by a new ignore_string config option, which will now cause Home Assistant to completely ignore devices with the matching string so that they will not be imported as a Home Assistant device at all. This can be helpful if you have nodes in the ISY that aren't useful at all in Hass (IR transmitter nodes are a good example.) ([@OverloadUT] - [#11243]) ([isy994 docs]) ([binary_sensor.isy994 docs]) ([cover.isy994 docs]) ([fan.isy994 docs]) ([light.isy994 docs]) ([lock.isy994 docs]) ([sensor.isy994 docs]) ([switch.isy994 docs]) (breaking change)
- The [`egardia` alarm panel][alarm_control_panel.egardia docs] platform no longer a need the users to run a separate Egardiaserver component. It can now also run on HASS.io. ([@jeroenterheerdt] - [#11344]) ([alarm_control_panel.egardia docs]) (breaking change)
- The binary sensor platform of the DoorBird integration has been deleted, so remove DoorBird from your `binary_sensor` configuration. Instead, set the `doorbell_events` option of the `doorbird` component to `True`. The `last_visitor` option has been removed from the camera component, as it is now always added as an entity. ([@Klikini] - [#11193]) ([camera.doorbird docs]) (breaking change)
- The following attributes of the TP-Link switch and light platform have been renamed:
  - Light: `current_consumption` -> `current_power_w`, `daily_consumption` -> `daily_energy_kwh` and `monthly_consumption` -> `monthly_energy_kwh`
  - Switch: `current` -> `current_a`, `current_consumption` -> `current_power_w`, `total_consumption` -> `total_energy_kwh` and `daily_consumption` -> `today_energy_kwh` ([@DanNixon] - [#10979]) ([light.tplink docs]) ([switch.tplink docs]) (breaking change)
- Move IMAP Email Content body to an attribute ([@notoriousbdg] - [#11096]) ([sensor.imap_email_content docs]) (breaking change)
- Automations which were using `state` that was returning `target_temperature` of the `netatmo` climate platform needs an update. ([@ciotlosm] - [#11345]) ([climate.netatmo docs]) (breaking change)
- The default availability payloads for the `MQTT` switch platform have changed from "ON" and "OFF" to "online" and "offline" (in order to match the majority of MQTT platforms that already supported availability reporting). ([@DanNixon] - [#11336]) (breaking change)
- Customizations for how entities are exposed to Alexa are no longer set via `customize`. Instead they are set via the configuration of the cloud component:

    ```yaml
    cloud:
      alexa:
        entity_config:
          switch.kitchen:
            name: 'Name for Alexa'
            description: 'Description for Alexa'
            display_categories: 'LIGHT'
    ```
  ([@balloob] - [#11461]) ([cloud docs]) ([alexa.smart_home docs]) (breaking change)
- The extension of the `alpha_vantage` requires an update of the configuration as now are exchange data available as well. ([@ChristianKuehnel] - [#11427]) ([sensor.alpha_vantage docs]) (breaking change)
- The `prometheus` component now supports pushing all sensors and fixes wrong metrics. If may require that you update your configuration. ([@michaelkuty] - [#11159]) ([prometheus docs]) (breaking change)
- Insteon local devices will now use their address as the `entity_id` and `name`. The friendly name can be customized using the [standard customization configuration](https://home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/). ([@camrun91] - [#11088]) ([insteon_local docs]) ([fan.insteon_local docs]) ([light.insteon_local docs]) ([switch.insteon_local docs]) (breaking change)
- Google Assistant is no longer configured via `customize` but instead has its configuration under the `google_assistant` entry in your `configuration.yaml`. The attributes will no longer have to be prefixed with `google_assistant_` either.

    | Old option | New option |
    | ---------- | ------------ |
    | google_assistant | expose |
    | aliases | aliases |
    | google_assistant_name | name |
    | google_assistant_type | type |

    Before:

    ```yaml
    homeassistant:
      customize:
        switch.kitchen:
          google_assistant: false
          google_assistant_name: nice lights
          google_assistant_type: light
          aliases:
            - roof lights

    google_assistant:
    ```

    After:

    ```yaml
    google_assistant:
      entity_config:
        switch.kitchen:
          expose: false
          alias: roof lights
          name: nice lights
          type: light
    ```
([@balloob] - [#11499]) ([cloud docs]) ([google_assistant docs]) (breaking change)
- The `climate.set_aux_heat` service is no longer available for the Sensibo climate platform. Now call `climate.turn_on` or `climate.turn_off`. ([@andrey-git] - [#11579]) ([climate.sensibo docs]) (breaking change)
- Release 0.61.0 introduced a lazy service loading strategy that relied on all components and platforms following our naming convention. After the release we realized that not all services did, which have been addressed by this fix.  This results in certain services changing names:

   ```
   todoist.new_task -> calendar.todoist_new_task

   snapcast.snapcast_snapshot -> media_player.snapcast_snapshot
   snapcast.snapcast_restore -> media_player.snapcast_restore

   mopar.remote_command -> sensor.mopar_remote_command

   broadlink.learn_command_192_168_0_107 -> switch.broadlink_learn_command_192_168_0_107
   broadlink.send_packet_192_168_0_107 -> switch.broadlink_send_packet_192_168_0_107
   ```
   ([@amelchio] - [#11677]) ([calendar.todoist docs]) ([media_player.snapcast docs]) ([media_player.soundtouch docs]) ([sensor.mopar docs]) ([switch.broadlink docs]) ([switch.scsgate docs]) (breaking change)

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/12/17/release-60/"/>
    <updated>2017-12-17T02:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/12/17/release-60</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href='/components/#version/0.60'><img src='/images/blog/2017-12-0.60/components.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

The biggest change for 0.60 will be covered in a separate [blog post](/blog/2017/12/17/introducing-home-assistant-cloud/). Thus, we will keep it short here. Just one thing: This is the last release in 2017. We will be back to our bi-weekly release cycle in 2018.

A big "Thank you" to all people who supported us to make this release possible.

## <a class='title-link' name='twincat' href='#twincat'></a> TwinCAT 
With the brand-new [ADS (automation device specification)][ads docs] component by [@stlehmann] allows you to hook Home Assistant into this fieldbus independent interface which is often used between Beckhoff devices running with TwinCAT.

## <a class='title-link' name='webdav-calendar' href='#webdav-calendar'></a> WebDav calendar 
Thanks to [@maxlaverse] Home Assistant support now [WebDav calendars][calendar.caldav docs].

## <a class='title-link' name='tracking-prices' href='#tracking-prices'></a> Tracking prices 
With the new [`gearbest` sensor][sensor.gearbest docs] there is now an additional sensor available to track the price of a product.

## <a class='title-link' name='financial-details' href='#financial-details'></a> Financial details 
Yahoo! has discontinued their financial service. To fill this gap we have now the [`alpha_vantage` sensor][sensor.alpha_vantage docs] which is intruded in this release and allows you to monitor the stock market.

We are proud to announce the availability of Home Assistant 0.59. To keep you in the loop: This is the second last release in 2017. We have stuck to our bi-weekly release cycle for another year but we decided that we will take a little break between Christmas and New Year.

## <a class='title-link' name='dominos-pizza-platform' href='#dominos-pizza-platform'></a> Dominos Pizza platform 
With the Dominos Pizza integration made by [@wardcraigj] your home is now taking care that you don't  starve. In combination with a [Skybell](/components/skybell/) or a [DoorBird](/components/doorbird/) you will know exactly when the pizza is in front of your door.

## <a class='title-link' name='color-picker' href='#color-picker'></a> Color picker 
[@NovapaX] created a new color picker. While dragging the color badge with your finger, a badge will appear above your finger so you can see the current color.

## <a class='title-link' name='shopping-list-tweaks' href='#shopping-list-tweaks'></a> Shopping list tweaks 
[@balloob] has refreshed the shopping list UI to make it more usable. It's now possible to add items by typing, instead of just voice. Also editting has been made easier.

## <a class='title-link' name='entity-picker' href='#entity-picker'></a> Entity picker 
[@balloob] improved the way if you want to pick an entity. In the automation editor, the script editor and the service section of the Developer Tools it's much easier to identify the right one! The automation editor will only suggest relevant entities.

    <updated>2017-11-18T04:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/11/18/release-58</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href='/components/#version/0.58'><img src='/images/blog/2017-11-0.58/components.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

<p class='note'>
The Hass.io release of 0.58 will be delayed by a couple of days because Pascal is moving this weekend.
</p>

## <a class='title-link' name='translation-update' href='#translation-update'></a> Translation update 

Translations are up and running in full speed. Shortly after the last release we got our translation pipeline figured out. [@armills] and [@c727] are doing an amazing job managing this project. We've doubled the number of supported languages to 42 and the amount of keys to translate went from 8 to 130. Our translaters are on top of their game and 79% is already translated.

Talking about our translators, we now have 445 people with an account to help with translations. Not bad for 3 weeks!

And because more translations is more better, [@robbiet480] has added the iOS app to Lokalise, our translation management platform. The iOS app is currently supported in 7 different languages.

[Learn more about how to help with translations](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/11/05/frontend-translations/)

## <a class='title-link' name='frontend-improvements-continue' href='#frontend-improvements-continue'></a> Frontend improvements continue 

Thanks to [@Andrey-git] we now are able to serve the frontend in modern JavaScript. Leveraging modern JavaScript makes the frontend faster to load and run. For now it's opt-in but we're looking into making it opt-out in the future. The ES5 version of the frontend will remain available for older devices.

To try it once, add `?latest` to your Home Assistant bookmark. To make it the default on your installation, update your config to look like this:

```
frontend:
  javascript_version: latest
```

<p class='note'>
For Custom UI users: your custom UI will need to be updated before it can work with the new version of the frontend.
</p>

### <a class='title-link' name='system-log-enhanced' href='#system-log-enhanced'></a> System log enhanced 

Our about screen that shows the error logs has gained a nice upgrade by [@postlund]. Now the 50 latest exceptions will be displayed with the option to get more information.

The Home Assistant sidebar in 12 different languages.
</p>

Whaaaaaats up everyone?! 😁 It's been another crazy 2 weeks here at the virtual Home Assistant headquarters with a ton of great contributions from all over the world. New features, bug fixes, performance improvements. It's a lot so let's jump right in.

## <a class='title-link' name='translations' href='#translations'></a> Translations 

The first great feature, if you haven't guessed it yet from the screenshot above: we are now able to translate the UI! Currently the translations are limited to the sidebar menu items. Even without a translation tool available, our contributors have jumped in and submitted translations for these menu items in over twenty languages! Home Assistant will automatically pick an available translation based on your browser settings, or a translation can be manually selected in the configuration panel.

We're currently working on an integration with the web based translation tool [lokalise.co](https://lokalise.co), to make the translation process accessible to anyone who would like to contribute. Stay tuned for a blog post with more documentation soon.

As part of getting translations to work, we did a lot of cleanup work on the frontend side. The re-organization should allow us to iterate faster on the frontend. We've already seen a lot of clean up as part of this thanks to @armills and @andrey-git for keep raising the quality!

## <a class='title-link' name='hacktoberfest' href='#hacktoberfest'></a> Hacktoberfest 

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) 2017 is over! FINALLY. Each year we're attracting more developers that want to contribute to Home Assistant. This is great but also very exhausting to our code reviewers. I want to give an enormous gigantic huge big shout out to our reviewers @pvizeli, @andrey-git, @armills, @MartinHjelmare, @fabaff. You have all done an amazing job and we couldn't run Home Assistant without any of you! ❤

Hacktoberfest is obviously about the people contributing to open source. Big thanks to everyone that has taken the time to learn our code base and make contributions. We hope it was a pleasant experience and show how great open source can be. Hope to see many contributions in the future 👍 

Here are our Hacktoberfest 2017 stats. It's a miracle everyone is still alive:

- Main repo: [273 Pull requests](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=merged%3A%3E2017-10-01%20is%3Apr%20label%3AHacktoberfest%20is%3Aclosed%20) were merged out of 307.
- Docs repo: [295 Pull requests](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.github.io/pulls?page=1&q=merged%3A%3E2017-10-01+is%3Apr+label%3AHacktoberfest+is%3Aclosed&utf8=%E2%9C%93) merged out of 310.
- Frontend: [57 pull requests](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=merged%3A%3E2017-10-01%20is%3Apr%20label%3AHacktoberfest%20is%3Aclosed%20) merged.

This means that we processed over 20 Pull requests per day. The result was already visible in 0.56. This release is almost the same. In those releases we were able to add over 40 new integrations.

## <a class='title-link' name='ikea-trdfri' href='#ikea-trdfri'></a> IKEA TRÅDFRI 

Good news and bad news on this front. The bad news is that IKEA changed the internal API for TRÅDFRI with a firmware update, breaking the Home Assistant integration. The good news is that they were nice enough to [email us with instructions on the breaking changes][ikea email].

Long time contributor [@lwis] jumped on the case and managed to migrate our integration in Home Assistant in time for this release. Great work!

Okay, one more highlight before we'll let you check out the changelog. Contributor [@danielperna84] (famous for creating the [HASS Configurator](https://home-assistant.io/addons/configurator/)), had another great component up his sleeve: the Timer component. With the timer component you'll be able to start countdown timers. A neat tool for your automation toolbox! More info in the [timer docs].

## <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes 

- IKEA TRÅDFRI: We no longer support entering the key in the configuration. ([@lwis] - [#10282]) ([tradfri docs]) (breaking change)
- API.AI was renamed to [Dialogflow](https://home-assistant.io/components/dialogflow/). This requires to rename the entry in your `configuration.yaml` file from `apiai:` to `dialogflow`. ([@fabaff] - [#10006]) ([dialogflow docs]) (breaking change)
- Wink: Removed support for entering your `username` and `password` in your config. Use the [new authentication method][wink-auth] instead. ([@w1ll1am23] - [#10277]) ([wink docs]) (breaking change)
- Use feed name assigned in EmonCMS if there is one. This changes the default behavior but still uses configured 'name' if it's set, so it won't break the configuration of people who have customized their feed names in HA config. ([@KlaasH] - [#10021]) ([sensor.emoncms docs]) (breaking change)
- The `namecheapdns` now uses `password:` instead of `access_token` in the configuration. Also, `host` is now optional which allow people who are not using subdomains to keep their configuration shorter. ([@fabaff] - [#10063]) ([namecheapdns docs]) (breaking change)
- Fix recorder crash for long state string - enforce a maximum state of 255 characters at core level ([@milanvo] - [#9696]) (breaking change)
- Add display currency setting to CoinMarketCap sensor. The name of the sensor attribute '24h_volume_usd' is changed to '24h_volume'. ([@R1chardTM] - [#10093]) ([sensor.coinmarketcap docs]) (breaking change)
- MQTT Statestream now serializes all data to JSON before publishing. This means that string attributes and values will be quoted from now on (e.g.: '"on"' instead of 'on'). You can still read these strings without the quotes by using 'value_json' instead of 'value' where applicable (e.g., templates). This causes automatic JSON deserialization. Other simple types are not affected.

  This fixes errors when an entity has an attribute that is not "a string, bytearray, int, float or None" and mqtt_statestream is used. As of now, the attribute is just handed over to paho, and paho can only send the aforementioned types. This patch fixes the issue by just casting everything to string before handing it over to paho.

  There are a number of components / entities which have "other" attributes, e.g. light that have an RGB attribute which is a list. ([@tinloaf] - [#9872]) ([mqtt_statestream docs]) (breaking change)
- Generic thermostat: the configuration option `tolerance` has been removed and has been replaced by `cold_tolerance` and `hot_tolerance`. This allows on and off states to have different error bands. ([@biggms] - [#9843]) ([climate.generic_thermostat docs]) (breaking change)
- Developers only: frontend has been refactored. The method `register_panel` has been turned into a coroutine function called `async_register_panel`. The parameter `url_path` has been renamed to `frontend_url_path`. For frontend, development, you no longer pass `development: 1` to the http component but instead configure the frontend component to be in development mode by pointing it at a local checkout of the Polymer repo: ([@balloob] - [#9915]) (breaking change)
